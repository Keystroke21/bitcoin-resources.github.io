Bitcoin's origin story is as mysterious as it is fascinating. Invented by a
pseudonymous creator and growing organically as dark market money in its early
days, Bitcoin's history is rich with eccentric characters and entrepreneurs. The
following books highlight some of these characters while shining some light on
Bitcoin's early days. I highly recommend
[The Book Satoshi][the-book-of-satoshi], which collects all known writings of
Bitcoin's creator and  [American Kingpin][american-kingpin], which is a gripping
retelling of Bitcoin's early days and its application on The Silk Road
marketplace. [The Blocksize Wars][the-blocksize-war] is required reading as
well, at least for anyone who wants to understand Bitcoin's civil war and the
nature of the politics involved in this global consensus system.
