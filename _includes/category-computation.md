While Bitcoin is in the business of verification and not computation, knowing
the limits of what computers can do and what future computers might be able to
do can be beneficial to better understand some parts of Bitcoin. I highly
recommend [Gödel, Escher, Bach][gödel-escher-bach] because it is a deeply
fascinating and beautiful book.

[Quantum Computing Since Democritus][quantum-computing-since-democritus] is
quite dense, but it is also quite entertaining at times. The [lecture
notes][quantum-computing-since-democritus-free] which this book is based upon
are freely available online. Note that the first couple of chapters stay in the
non-quantum world of computing and might help to understand why breaking
Bitcoin's security is so hard. [A New Kind of Science][a-new-kind-of-science] is
certainly not for everyone, but it beautifully shows how simple rules can lead
to complex systems.
