Bitcoin is capable of being the new base layer of our economy, which is why
understanding economics is essential in understanding Bitcoin. Bitcoin's
monetary policy is aligned with the Austrian School of economic thought, which
is why reading the works of Austrian's such as Hayek, Hazlitt, Hoppe, Menger,
Mises, Rothbard (and others) is recommended by those who take Bitcoin's value
proposition seriously.

Human Action, Mises' magnum opus, is [freely available][human-action-free] as
both an ebook and an audiobook.
