Bitcoin is an empowering, freedom-enabling technology. It allows individuals to
become self-sovereign in matters of money and finance, just like other
information technologies enable self-sovereignty in matters of information and
communication. What this implies, and how the world might change because of it,
is the scope of [The Sovereign Individual].

We are currently living through the fourth great shift, moving from an
industrial to an information-based society. There is no better book to
understand this shift than the one by Davidson and Rees-Mogg.
