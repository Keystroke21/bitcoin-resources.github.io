Good money is a moral issue. Free speech and sound money are paramount for a
free and flourishing society. Read these books to understand why.

[Moral questions][speech] are at the root of it all: Who should be allowed to
speak? Who should be allowed to publish? Who should be allowed to have property?
Who should be allowed to defend said property? Who should be allowed to issue
and control the money?
