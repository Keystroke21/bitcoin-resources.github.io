Bitcoin is free, libre open-source software. It is free as in freedom, free as
in free speech. What this means, why free software exists, and what the
implications of free (vs proprietary) software are, is important to understand
the unstoppability of Bitcoin. I would argue that the ethos of GNU and UNIX
programming are important cornerstones for Bitcoin as well.
