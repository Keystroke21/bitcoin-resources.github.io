Highly improbable events, such as the invention of Bitcoin, are almost
impossible to predict. However, Nassim Taleb wrote multiple
books on concepts that help to foster a solid understanding of Bitcoin. In
short, the invention of Bitcoin is a *Black Swan* event resulting in an
*antifragile* organism. Miners are *"fooled by randomness"* to keep it alive,
and participation requires *skin in the game*. Unfortunately, Taleb [fails to
appreciate][fragile-nassim] the beauty of Bitcoin and
currently suffers from [Bitcoin Derangement Syndrome][BDS].
