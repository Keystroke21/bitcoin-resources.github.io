quote: "Bitcoin, because it replaces money as the thing everyone exchanges for goods and services, will be the biggest software project in the history of the world, touching more people than television did, and spreading prosperity everywhere at the speed of light, eliminating payer and identity fraud, opening the third world to e-commerce, and saving everyone billions. Anything that stops this, slows it down, increases friction, and seeks to prevent its spread is against humanity."
