description: "Who knew that the Bible had so much to say about the issues of money and banking? The issue is a serious one because of the important history here and also because the Bible is such a foundational part of public understanding of every issue of public life and morality. You can search the libraries for weeks and not find a guide as good as Gary North's detailed account of every mention of money and banking in both the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures. What he finds underscores what the hard-money tradition has long said. Governments engage in evil when they change the definition of money. Inflation is a danger to the individual and society. Governments that monopolize the monetary system are abusing their power. Governments cannot be trusted with money. That's the lesson."
