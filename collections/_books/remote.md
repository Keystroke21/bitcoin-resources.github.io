quote: "That’s the great irony of letting passionate people work from home. A manager’s natural instinct is to worry about his workers not getting enough work done, but the real threat is that too much will likely get done. And because the manager isn’t sitting across from his worker anymore, he can’t look in the person’s eyes and see burnout."

description: "The Industrial Revolution's 'under one roof' model of conducting work is steadily declining owing to technology that is rapidly creating virtual workspaces and allowing workers to provide their vital contribution without physically clustering together.

Bitcoin requires meaningful work, creative work, thoughtful work, important work—this type of effort takes stretches of uninterrupted time to get into the zone. But in the modern office such long stretches usually can’t be found. Instead, it’s just one interruption after another.

In Remote, authors Fried and DHH will convince readers that letting all or part of work teams function remotely is a great idea---and they're going to show precisely how a remote work setup can be accomplished."
